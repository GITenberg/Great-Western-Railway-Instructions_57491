<p>The amount of &ldquo;cant&rdquo; to be given to a curve is
governed by the speed at which trains run over it, and in no case
must the raising of the outer rail in Running Lines be less than
is given in the column headed &ldquo;Minimum Cant,&rdquo; except
where necessary to meet special cases, as at switches, crossings
and junctions.&nbsp; In curves on falling gradients where high
speeds are run, the outer rail must be kept well up, while on
rising gradients a lesser &ldquo;cant,&rdquo; but within the
limits of the latter, must be given.&nbsp; On gradients on single
lines the outer rail of curves must, as a rule, be raised to suit
the speed of descending trains.</p>
<p>The superelevation must be gradually attained at the rate of 1
inch in each 66 feet length as the curve is <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>approached,
maintained uniformly over the whole length of the curve, and run
out after passing the curve in the same way.</p>
<p>On reverse curves, or curves with very short pieces of
straight between them, the &ldquo;cant&rdquo; must be made
gradually on the curves commencing at the middle of the short
piece of straight in the latter case.</p>
<h3>EXPLANATION.</h3>
<p>Stretch a cord measuring exactly a chain (66 feet) across the
inner side of the curve, and measure the distance (C D) between
the inner edge of the rail and the cord, as shewn in sketch
below.</p>
<p>Look for this measurement in the column headed
&ldquo;Offset,&rdquo; opposite to which, in the column headed
&ldquo;Radius of Curve,&rdquo; will be found the radius of the
curve in chains; and in the columns headed &ldquo;Minimum
Cant&rdquo; or &ldquo;Maximum Cant&rdquo; will be found how much
the outer rail is to be raised above the inner one, according to
the speed of trains.</p>

</a></p>
<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>
<p>Suppose the distance between the inner edge of the rail and
the cord at C D is found to be 2&frac12; inches, the column
headed &ldquo;Radius of Curve,&rdquo; shews it to have a curve of
40 chains radius; and those headed &ldquo;Minimum Cant&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Maximum Cant&rdquo; will shew that the outer rail must be
raised 2&frac14; inches higher than the inner one for a speed of
40 miles an hour, or 5&#8539; inches for a speed of 60 miles an
hour.</p>

<p>In laying the 45 ft., 44 ft. 6 in., 39 ft. 5 in., 32 ft., 29

left at the joints, according to the temperature for the

<p>For laying down new permanent way iron expansion gauges, equal
in thickness to the respective spaces given, to be used.</p>
<p>Wooden gauges must on no account be allowed.</p>
<p>The expansion granges must, as far as possible, be allowed to
remain in the joints until they are properly fished up, and the
road slewed into its proper line and &ldquo;topped.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>GAUGE AND CHECKING OF CURVES.</h2>
<p>When laying new lines, or relaying in curves of 10 chains
radius and above in plain line work, the gauge of the road must
be laid to the standard width of 4 ft. 8&frac12; in., but in
curves of less than 10 chains radius, worked over by Passenger
and Goods Trains, the gauge may be slightly eased according to
the radius of the curve and other circumstances.</p>
<p>The check rail in plain road is to be second-hand bull-head
rail, and all curves of Passenger lines of 10 chains radius, and
under, must be continuously checked; the check rail in all cases
to extend, where possible, for a length of 50 feet or thereabouts
outside the commencing and terminating points of the curve to be
checked.</p>
<p>Continuous check chairs for plain road, are of two patterns,
one allowing a clearance of 1&frac34; in. to be used in curves of
10 chains radius, and the other allowing a clearance of 2 in. to
be used in curves under 10 chains, both rails in each, case being
level on top.</p>
<p>In sharp reverse or &ldquo;S&rdquo; curves in plain line work
where a piece of straight line cannot be given, the junction of
the two curves must be laid with check rails on both sides, each
check to be laid to cover the other for a safe distance.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
